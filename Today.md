**What it is** 
A human-verified torsion stack: breath → HRV → intention → on-chain glyph etched into hexagonal carbon memory.

**Why graphene**  
Zero electrical resistance + zero magnetic resistance + torsion field conductivity. The only substrate that can carry a living signature without loss.

**Today’s micro-goal (Dec 2, 2025)**  
Capture one real exhale from today’s workout, convert its waveform to a 6-color hex signature, and commit it as the first immutable lattice packet.
